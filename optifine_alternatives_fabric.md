# The list is moving out!

**If you share this list, please use this link instead: https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives**

It may still be only a redirection link, but it will have a better web display of the list soon. And the list being on GitHub/GitHub pages improves load times.

The gist version of this list will stop being updated.

# Why?

OptiFine was originally a great mod offering many quality of life improvements for player in the beginning. However, over the years, its benefits have dwindled and has caused many issues for modders. This is due to Minecraft's codebase improving over the years and OptiFine's aggressiveness towards replacing entire swaths of code while being closed source making it very difficult to figure out why OptiFine has broken another modder's mod. 
Also worth noting that OptiFine natively doesn't support Fabric and it's hard to maintain OptiFabric.

In the modern Minecraft era, with Fabric's community effort, modders have begun to create alternatives for most of OptiFine's features to allow players to maintain better performance, better mod compatibility, and better support.

# This list

This list will list recommended OptiFine alternatives by me (LambdAurora), so it has some requirements for mods to be listed here:
 - They must be publicly available, if it's only accessible through Discord they are not eligible.
 - Mods must respect the Minecraft's EULA.
 - Mods must not refer to a cheat client.
 - Mods that change gameplay in a way (e.g. zoom) that have a way for servers to disable them will be favored.

This list now has a fancy URL: https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives
